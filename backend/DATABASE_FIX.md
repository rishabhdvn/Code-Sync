# Database Connection Fix

## Issue Fixed
- Fixed the missing `DATABASE_URL` environment variable error
- Restored the database configuration from the backup
- Added retry logic to database connection
- Made server start even if database connection fails (limited functionality)

## Changes Made

1. **Restored Environment Variables**:
   - Restored `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` from `.env.backup`
   - Saved the Ethereal email configuration as `.env.ethereal` for future use

2. **Enhanced Database Connection**:
   - Added retry logic (5 attempts with 5 second delay)
   - Improved error logging with redacted credentials
   - Added fallback local database URL if environment variable is missing

3. **Modified Server Startup**:
   - Server now starts immediately without waiting for database connection
   - Database connection attempts happen in the background
   - Server continues running with limited functionality if database connection fails

## How to Switch Configurations

### For Database Access (Production/Development)
```bash
cp .env.backup .env
echo "LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY=sk_dev_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" >> .env
```

### For Email Testing (Ethereal)
```bash
cp .env.ethereal .env
```

## Troubleshooting Database Issues

If you're still having issues with the database connection:

1. **Check Supabase Status**:
   - Visit the Supabase dashboard to verify the database is online

2. **Verify Credentials**:
   - Ensure the username and password in DATABASE_URL are correct
   - Check if IP restrictions are in place on Supabase

3. **Test Direct Connection**:
   - Try connecting directly using the DIRECT_URL instead of DATABASE_URL
   - Use a database client like pgAdmin to test the connection

4. **Network Issues**:
   - Check if your network allows outbound connections on ports 5432 and 6543
   - Try connecting from a different network or using a VPN

5. **Local Development Alternative**:
   - Consider setting up a local PostgreSQL database for development
   - Update DATABASE_URL to point to your local database
